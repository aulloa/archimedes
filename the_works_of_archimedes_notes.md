## The works of Archimedes - T.L Heath

### Preface
 - Apparently this book is a companion book to another one descibing Apollonius' Conic Sections
   - Appollonius of Perga
   - Who came shortly after achimedes. Who came after euclid.
   - Apollonius was concerned with the geometry of forms and situations
   - Archimedes concerned with the geometry of measurements.
 - **Archimedes performed integration!**

### Introduction
 - Unrecovered biography from Heracleides
 - Died 75
 - Born ~ 287 B.C.
 - Son of Pheidas(astronomer)
 - Intimate if not related to Hieron and son(Gelon)
 - Diodorus says he spent time in Alexandira ***friends***
   - Influences by Euclid(followers) 
   - May have been where he met his friends
     - Conon of Sanos
     - Eratosthenes
     - Diotheus of Pelusium(student of conon)(dedicated books to him)
  - Made himself famous for mechanical inventions, but took no pride in it?
    - Only one book for this topic, on making of spheres
  - Mechanical weapons put to use against Romans
    - Catapults which could change range(thousand handed gods)
    - Dropping heavy weights or claws on ships
    - romans so scared when they saw a rope or wood from a wall they would turn and run in terror
    - Died in the sack of syracuse.
    - Do not disturb my circles
    - grave enscribed cyclinder with sphere in it
      - ratio on it also
      - He thought it his greatist achievement (why?)
  - Forget all about food, and neccesities
  - Draw geometrical figures in ash
  - eureka, eureka!
  - Give me a place to stand on and I can move the earth
    - said to heiron if given another earth he would walk over to it and move this one
    - Heiron said prove it
    - Archimedes launched a great ship madde for Ptolomey by himself using a compound pully
    - From that day forward heiron declared "from that day forth Archimedes was to be believed in everything that he might say"
  - Also inveted archimedes screw
    - irrigation
    - water out of mines
    - water out of ships holds
  - Sphere imitating motions of the sky
    - Moon, 5 planets, sun
    - predicted eclipses
  - In sand-reckoner archimedes measured diamter of sun, or angle subtended by eye?
  - Legend that he set roman ships using mirrors, no reference before Lucian
  - Legend of the loculus Archimedes, puzzle. At this point naming something archimedian could just be a description meaning "cleaverly made"

## Chapter 2 - Manuscripts and Principal Editions-Orer of Composition-Dialect-Lost Works

 - Three most important manuscripts
   - F = Codex Florentinus bibliothecase Laurentiane Mediceae plutei
   - B = Codex Parisinux 2360, olim mediceus
   - C = Codex Parisinus 2361, Fonteblandensis
   - F is most trustworthy
 - All contain the same works of archimedes
   - de sphaera et cylindro
   - de demensione circuli
   - de conoidibus
   - de lineis spiralbus
   - de planis aeque ponderantibus
   - arenarius
   - quadratura parabolae
 - Chronological Order (best guess)
   - On the equilibrium of planes
   - Quadrature of the parabola
   - On the equilibrium of planes 2
   - On the sphere and cylinder 1, 2, 3
   - On spirale
   - On Conoids and Spheriods
   - On floating bodies 1, 2, 3
   - Measurement of a circle
   - The sand-reckoner
   - The cattle problem is somewhere in here, maybe not even authored by him

 - Lost possible works
   - Polyhedra
   - Apxai Principles (naming of numbers..)
   - On balances or Levers
   - On centres of Gravity
   - An optical work
   - On sphere making
   - Method (recently discovered) ***Maybe the most important for this channel***
     - Released as another book supplementing this one
   - Calander

### Chapter 3 - Relation of Archimedes to his Predecessors
- Archimedes, unlike euclid or apollonus was no compiler
  - he did not spend time systemizing and generalizing knowledge around him
- He was plain when talking about other peoples work, focusing on solving what he was going to solve
- In his book on spirals he said 2 previous propositions were wrong
